Every failure of quality control is a failure of version control. Every weakness in your report is a manifestation of weakness in your version control system.

Every typo in your report; every chart mislabeled; every cross-reference misattributed; every lit review misrepresented; every error in your quant analysis is a failure or a weakness in your version control system.

This is not something you need to be persuaded on: it is definitionally true. It follows immediately from the definition of a version control system.

What is a version control system?

To describe a version control system, I want to tell a story. 

John the lumberjack is an excellent logger. He is both strong, able to fell mighty trees, and knowledgable -- able to tell whether the wood will make good quality timber.
He works in remote areas, far from roads, and far from the lumber mill he is contracted by. 
No matter. 
The places he works has many fast-flowing rivers, sufficiently deep that he can just float the logs down.
The lumber mill is located on a major river in the valley.

After a month's hard work felling a mountain forest, he hikes down to the lumber mill to collect his cheque.
"But we never got any logs from you," says Jill, head of logging logs. 

John is the victim of a poor version control system. 
In fact the valley looks like

John's logs went out to sea. 
He did not have high assurance from the cartography that the he was felling abeam a tributary of the main river.  






I want to break up a version control system (or VCS) into three parts, which I will call -- rather idiosyncratically -- source control, version control, and revision control.

Source control is the enforcement of rules governing what is allowed in the final report. In practice, this means enforcing that:
* everything placed in a report was intended to be placed in the report; no-one accidentally puts something in a report they shouldn't have.
* everything put in a report is reviewed
* everything in a report is attributable to someone, some time, and some motivation

Version control is the assurance to an author that any work intended for the report will either be admitted to the report, or rejected after a fair review.

Revision control is a service to authors whereby they are alerted to modifications downstream of their changes.
